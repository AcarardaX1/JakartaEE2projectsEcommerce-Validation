# JakartaEE2projectsEcommerce-Validation
My 2 Java JakartaEE projects including persistence usage, maven dependency(s) and possible implementiations to databases(i.e. postgreSQL)

1st Project(letPartyBegin) includes a Party Validation software to gather attendee information(i.e. date of birth, First Name, Last Name) and Party Info(i.e Party Name, Party Date)  

Its validation part starts with the attendees' participation to party(s) and returns as a list of the attendees' information indicated above in a Web page(partydetails.xhtml) 

For the 2nd Project(shoppee), It is basically tending on a E-Commerce website that having Cart, Item and CartItem(like a basket) to view the products and its' info(i.e. Name, quantity)

I have used IDE for Apache NetBeans 25 version for writing and compiling the code.

For its Front-End and HTML(as of xhtml file(s) ) part, I have utilized PrimeFaces/OmniFaces to make the JSF files more elaborted.

All the projects is designed within the leadership of @dmainardi at @Prosystem Ingegneri Affiliati and resulted in ending the course as a title of "Jakarta EE Programming Course"
